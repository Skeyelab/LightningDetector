  - Fixed firmware manifest format to match ESP Web Tools requirements (based on npmjs.com/package/esp-web-tools documentation)
  - Created separate manifests for transmitter and receiver firmware
  - Updated main.js to use actual manifest files instead of dynamic creation
  - Removed obsolete `createFirmwareManifest()` function
  - Started Vite development server on port 3000
- Commands run:
  - `pio run -e sender` (built transmitter firmware)
  - `pio run -e receiver` (built receiver firmware)
  - `cp .pio/build/sender/firmware.bin web-flasher/sender_firmware_v1.0.0.bin`
  - `cp .pio/build/receiver/firmware.bin web-flasher/receiver_firmware_v1.0.0.bin`
  - `cd web-flasher && npm run dev` (started development server)
- Files touched:
  - `web-flasher/sender_firmware_v1.0.0.bin` (created from built firmware)
  - `web-flasher/receiver_firmware_v1.0.0.bin` (created from built firmware)
  - `web-flasher/firmware_manifest.json` (updated to ESP Web Tools format)
  - `web-flasher/receiver_manifest.json` (created for receiver firmware)
  - `web-flasher/src/main.js` (updated to use manifest files)
- Next steps:
  - Test web-flasher at http://localhost:3000
  - Verify ESP Web Tools can detect and flash firmware
  - Test with actual ESP32 device
  - Consider building and testing both firmware variants

#### 2025-01-15 20:00 UTC
