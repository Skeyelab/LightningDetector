- Context: **COMPLETED** ERI-14 Linear issue to remove RX/TX switching from button functionality
- Changes:
  - Removed RX/TX mode switching from button short press functionality
  - Eliminated `savePersistedRole()` and `oledRole()` functions
  - Updated `loadPersistedSettingsAndRole()` to `loadPersistedSettings()` (no role loading)
  - Reworked button functionality to be device-specific:
    * Sender: Short press cycles LoRa parameters (SF, BW, TX Power), Medium press broadcasts config
    * Receiver: Short press cycles display modes, Medium press changes network mode
    * Both: Long press enters config mode, 5 rapid clicks enters sleep mode
  - Updated `ButtonAction` enum to remove `ToggleMode` and add device-specific actions
  - Implemented multi-click detection for sleep mode functionality
  - Updated integration tests to reflect new button behavior
  - Device role now fixed at build time via `ROLE_SENDER`/`ROLE_RECEIVER` build flags
  - Fixed missing `app_logic.h` include in `main.cpp` causing build failures
- Commands run:
  - `g++ -std=c++17 verify_button_logic.cpp -o verify_button_logic && ./verify_button_logic`
  - `pio run -e sender && pio run -e receiver` (verified successful builds)
