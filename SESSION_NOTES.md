### Session log

#### 2025-01-27 15:30 UTC
- Context: Implemented multi-network WiFi system to support home and work networks with automatic fallback.
- Changes:
  - `src/wifi_config.h`:
    - Replaced single WiFi config with multi-network structure
    - Added WiFiNetwork struct with SSID, password, location, and priority
    - Added NetworkSelectionMode enum for AUTO, MANUAL_HOME, MANUAL_WORK modes
    - Added connection timeout and retry configuration
  - `src/wifi_manager.h` & `src/wifi_manager.cpp`:
    - Created new WiFi manager implementation with automatic fallback
    - Added persistent storage of network preferences
    - Implemented priority-based network selection
    - Added manual network mode switching
  - `src/main.cpp`:
    - Updated to use new WiFi manager instead of direct WiFi calls
    - Added button functionality to cycle through network modes (receiver only)
    - Updated status bar to show current network location
    - Added periodic WiFi connection checking and reconnection
    - Wrapped WiFi-specific button functionality in ENABLE_WIFI_OTA preprocessor directives
  - `wifi_networks_example.h`: Created example configuration template
  - `WIFI_MULTI_NETWORK_README.md`: Comprehensive documentation
- Commands run:
  - Created multiple new files for WiFi management system
  - Fixed compilation errors by reorganizing function definitions
  - Successfully built both receiver and sender environments
- Files touched:
  - `src/wifi_config.h`, `src/wifi_manager.h`, `src/wifi_manager.cpp`, `src/main.cpp`
  - `wifi_networks_example.h`, `WIFI_MULTI_NETWORK_README.md`
- Features implemented:
  - Multiple WiFi networks with priority-based fallback
  - Manual network mode selection via button press
  - Persistent storage of network preferences
  - Automatic reconnection and network monitoring
  - OLED display shows current network location
  - Compatible with both WiFi-enabled (receiver) and WiFi-disabled (sender) builds
- Build status: âœ… SUCCESS - Both receiver and sender environments compile without errors
- Next steps:
  - Test multi-network functionality with actual home/work networks
  - Verify automatic fallback behavior
  - Test button-based network mode switching
  - Consider moving network credentials to external file for security

#### 2025-08-14 01:40 UTC
- Context: Working on cascade OTA; receiver broadcasts LoRa notices post WiFi OTA; transmitters not reacting yet.
- Changes:
  - `src/main.cpp`:
    - Sender-side: now listens for `FW_UPDATE_AVAILABLE`/`UPDATE_NOW` and sends `REQUEST_UPDATE`; enabled LoRa OTA receive/flash (`handleLoraOtaPacket`, `checkLoraOtaTimeout`) for both roles; ensured `Update.h` included for sender.
    - Receiver-side: on WiFi OTA end, stores firmware (stub), broadcasts CFG on control channel, sends 10 update notices, and listens 15s for `REQUEST_UPDATE`; only receiver sends firmware.
  - `SESSION_NOTES.md`: updated with progress and next steps.
- Commands run:
  - `pio run -e sender`, `pio run -e receiver`
  - `pio run -e receiver --target upload --upload-port 192.168.3.210`
  - `git add -A && git commit -m "feat(ota): sender RX path; stronger cascade trigger; notes"` (push blocked by auth)
- Files touched:
  - `src/main.cpp`, `SESSION_NOTES.md`
- Observations:
  - Receiver OTA succeeds and triggers cascade messages.
  - Transmitters (TX) currently show no "FW update notice" logs; likely running old firmware or RF settings mismatch.
- Next steps:
  - Flash at least one TX with latest sender build and monitor serial during receiver OTA.
  - Implement real firmware transfer (base64 chunking and actual binary), checksums, versioning.
  - Add manual cascade trigger (e.g., long-press) on receiver for testing without WiFi OTA.
  - Verify TX role (OLED shows TX) and LoRa params alignment; keep devices close during tests.

#### 2025-08-14 01:20 UTC
- Context: Implemented status bar, WiFi OTA, and cascade LoRa OTA trigger on receiver. Added sender-side LoRa OTA receive path.
- Changes:
  - `src/main.cpp`:
    - Added bottom status bar (WiFi/OTA/LoRaOTA indicators); moved settings up.
    - Implemented WiFi OTA on receiver (hostname/password from `src/wifi_config.h`).
    - After WiFi OTA completes, receiver stores firmware (stub) and broadcasts LoRa update notifications, listens for `REQUEST_UPDATE`, and sends firmware over LoRa.
    - Enabled LoRa OTA receive/flash handling on sender (process `FW_UPDATE_AVAILABLE`/`UPDATE_NOW`, send `REQUEST_UPDATE`, handle `OTA_*` packets and flash using Update).
    - Made `handleLoraOtaPacket` and timeout handling available to both roles; kept sender TX path disabled.
  - `platformio.ini`:
    - Receiver: set `upload_protocol = espota` and `upload_flags = --auth=123456`.
  - `src/wifi_config.h`: confirmed OTA password/hostname.
  - Created this `SESSION_NOTES.md`.
- Commands run:
  - `pio run -e receiver`
  - `pio run -e sender`
  - `pio run -e receiver --target upload --upload-port 192.168.3.210`
- Files touched:
  - `src/main.cpp`, `platformio.ini`, `src/wifi_config.h`, `SESSION_NOTES.md`
- Next steps:
  - Verify sender receives FW notifications and performs LoRa OTA.
  - Replace firmware storage stub with real binary (read from flash / file).
  - Add versioning and integrity (checksum) for LoRa OTA.
