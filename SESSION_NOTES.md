#### 2025-01-14 15:00 UTC
- Context: Identified that esp-web-flasher library is deprecated and cannot be loaded directly from CDN
- Changes:
  - Investigated npm registry to confirm esp-web-flasher is deprecated
  - Found that esptool-js is the new official replacement
  - Discovered that both libraries are ES modules designed for bundlers, not direct browser loading
- Commands run:
  - `curl -s "https://registry.npmjs.org/esp-web-flasher" | head -20`
  - `curl -s "https://registry.npmjs.org/esptool-js" | head -20`
  - `curl -s "https://unpkg.com/esptool-js@latest/lib/index.js" | head -5`
- Next steps:
  - Implement proper npm-based solution with GitHub Actions
  - Use bundler to create browser-compatible JavaScript

#### 2025-01-14 14:45 UTC
- Context: Fixed release workflow caching strategy by removing ineffective build artifacts cache
- Changes:
  - Removed build artifacts cache since it never gets cache hits for releases
  - Each release has unique commit hashes, making cache keys always different
  - Kept dependency caching (PlatformIO core, libraries, Python packages) which is effective
  - Added explanatory comments about why build artifacts aren't cached
  - Improved workflow clarity and removed wasted storage operations
- Commands run:
  - `git add .github/workflows/release.yml`
  - `git commit -m "fix: remove ineffective build artifacts cache from release workflow"`
  - `git push`
- Files touched:
  - `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- Next steps:
  - Monitor release workflow performance
  - Consider implementing effective caching strategies for future releases
